# Survelliance System
A standalone surveillance system implemented using a raspberry pi

## Overview
This project was done as a mini project for my 12th grade. It is a surveillance system that captures frames when motion is detected within its      range via an IR sensor, aiming to identify any and all persons within each frame using a python library against a database of user-provided images of persons. All sightings are uploaded onto the Apache server and indexed via the time as well as persons within each frame. Additionally, the user is also informed of the sighting of flagged individuals, as uploaded onto the database by the user, via a push API.
